    "body": "Firstly, thanks for this brilliant library. Love this project and have used it in production without many problems.\r\n\r\nJust something I want to give back to the devs/maintainers.\r\n\r\n- It would be ideal to distribute the files as a UMD instead of a single top-level function. Here's an example of a library distributed as such https://github.com/521dimensions/amplitudejs\r\n\r\n- In some frameworks, the code is passed as a string to `eval` function which doesn't add the library to the global scope which may present some issues. Here's a discussion which maybe helpful https://meta.discourse.org/t/a-question-regiarding-loading-js-libraries-via-register-asset/156003"

I have tried to set video elements srcObject using getDataUrl() method but it is not working. \r\nThe video recording is working fine and I am able to download it once recorded but I want it to preview it after recording and if user is happy then a button click with upload to the server. \r\nI would really appreciate your help."

    "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nFirst off, thanks @muaz-khan and contributors for the project. It's a big help! 💖 \r\n\r\nI'm running into an interesting issue. It _looks like_ there's some kind of issue with the `timeSlice` argument that's causing invalid blobs to be created, especially on slower machines and especially with `getDisplayMedia` as opposed to `getUserMedia`. \r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n```js      \r\nlet recorder = RecordRTC(stream, {\r\n  timeSlice: 100\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill cause the eventual blob to be malformed (it won't play in VideoJS for instance, and `ffmpeg` on the server will sometimes read it, sometimes not).\r\n\r\nIf you make the `timeSlice` a little longer, say `1000`, everything will work fine. \r\n\r\nI haven't had time to dig into the code and see if I can figure out what's going on I'm afraid, but I did create a minimal reproduction in [this JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/nikz3/47t596np/6/).\r\n\r\nIf you choose 10 or 100ms from the dropdown, you'll get something like this:\r\n\r\n\u003cimg width=\"725\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6474/84087085-7cb22c80-aa3d-11ea-9713-8b4cc494e3d5.png\"\u003e\r\n\r\nWhereas if you choose a longer time slice or have a faster machine, you'll get a valid video of your screen playing in VideoJS.\r\n\r\nI'd love to dig further and I'm happy to submit a PR - but I wanted to see if someone could point me in the right direction (or tell me what I'm doing wrong!)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! \r\n\r\nNik"

    "body": "Hi.\r\nWe are using RecordRTC.js  in a web application to record audio samples from different candidates. The recordings are from one minute to two minutes long. After the recording is done on client side, base 64 encoded string is sent to server & it gets saved into an audio file. This works fine in Google Chrome & Firefox. In Safari, a minute long file is 10 times more in size than Chrome and the post to server side fails. While recording in Safari, StereoAudioRecorder(as MediaStreamRecorder is not supported)  is used & an 'uncompressed - wav' audio stream  is generated. We tried different options to compress the stream on client and were unsuccessful. This feature is extremely critical to our project. Any kind of help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks"
